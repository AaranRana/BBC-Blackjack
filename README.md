# Blackjack

This project has been made by Aaran Rana, and simulates Blackjack, using Java.

You are able to:

- When the game starts, you are given 2 cards.
- Hit, Stand or look at your cards each "turn".
- When you hit, you are given a card, and your score increases.
    - If you go over 21, you are bust.
    - If you are over 21, but have an ace, your ace will turn to 1.
    - If you have five cards and are under 21, you will automatically win.
- If you stand, you can no longer take any more cards.
    - A dealer will then attempt to beat your score.
    - The dealer will draw cards until they either:
        - Go bust.
        - Beat you.
    - You win if the dealer goes bust.
    - You lose if the dealer is either above OR equal to your score.
- You can also look at your cards.
    - This just prints out your hand, and score, again.

The project has been thoroughly commented.
